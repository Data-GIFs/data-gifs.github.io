                    <span>To gain an understanding of what makes a data-GIF understandable to its audience, we conduct a qualitative study through semi-structured interviews, complemented by an extensive online study with with a total of 118 participants. We use a representative subset of 20 of our collected real-world GIFs in order to reduce the studyâ€™s complexity. The studies indicate that many design factors have an impact on the understandability of data-GIFs.</span>
                    
                    <p>This page presents a set of design suggestions for creating more effective data-GIFs which we derived from the results. Details about our experiments can be found in the <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07227'>paper</a>. The study materials can be downloaded <a href=''>here</a>, including the stimuli GIFs and questionnaires for participants, as well as their responses.</p>
